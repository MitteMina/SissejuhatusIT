<pre>  In this website is a list of a few games that i have played which i enjoyed.
In the list i wrote the name of the games and the amount that i have spent
playing those games with a rating at the end.
  The first game that i listed was League of Legends, which is a MOBA game.
It is the most popular MOBA out there. Unfortunately the games community is
the worst part of the game. The player base is really toxic against new
players and aggressive when you make the slightest mistake in the game.
Because of that i gave a low rating to the game.
  Next game that i listed was Skyrim, which is my favorite game of all time.
The game is a singleplayer, sandbox, open world game, which gives the player
many options to choose from how they want to play the game. It is my favorite
game because it was the first game in which i felt there were no barriers, that 
i could do whatever i wanted to do in the game. I gave a 5/5 rating to the game
but i would say that the graphics of the game did not age well.
